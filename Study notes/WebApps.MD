## Getting Started with Azure App Service
### What is Azure App Service?

Azure App Service is a platform for building and hosting:

--> Web apps  
--> Mobile back ends  
--> RESTful APIs  

It allows you to use your language of choice without managing the underlying infrastructure, as Azure provides most of what you need to run your preferred stack.

Azure App Service supports:  
- .NET  
- Java (Java SE, Tomcat, and JBoss EAP)  
- Node.js  
- Python  
- PHP  
- Custom containers  

Depending on your needs, you can choose scaling or auto-scaling options, select between a Windows or Linux OS, and enable automated deployments.
