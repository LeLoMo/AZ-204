### What is Azure App Service?

Azure App Service is a platform as a service (PaaS) for building and hosting:

- Web apps  
- Mobile back ends  
- RESTful APIs  

It allows you to use your language of choice without managing the underlying infrastructure, as Azure provides most of what you need to run your preferred stack.

--> Azure App Service is a fully managed web application hosting platform.

Azure App Service supports:  
- .NET  
- Java (Java SE, Tomcat, and JBoss EAP)  
- Node.js  
- Python  
- PHP  
- Custom containers  

Depending on your needs, you can choose scaling or auto-scaling options, select between a Windows or Linux OS, and enable automated deployments.
